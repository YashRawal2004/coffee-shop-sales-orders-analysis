## 📌 Project Overview
**Note: This is a practice project developed for educational purposes to demonstrate data analysis and Power BI skills.**

This project involves analyzing sales transaction data for a coffee shop to reveal key insights regarding customer purchase behavior, product performance, and operational trends. The interactive Power BI dashboard allows stakeholders to visualize cumulative sales, track Month-over-Month (MoM) growth, and identify peak operational hours.

The goal of this analysis is to provide data-driven recommendations to optimize staffing, inventory management, and marketing strategies.
